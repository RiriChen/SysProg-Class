/*
 *  build_cmd_list
 *    cmd_line:     the command line from the user
 *    clist *:      pointer to clist structure to be populated
 *
 *  This function builds the command_list_t structure passed by the caller
 *  It does this by first splitting the cmd_line into commands by spltting
 *  the string based on any pipe characters '|'.  It then traverses each
 *  command.  For each command (a substring of cmd_line), it then parses
 *  that command by taking the first token as the executable name, and
 *  then the remaining tokens as the arguments.
 *
 *  NOTE your implementation should be able to handle properly removing
 *  leading and trailing spaces!
 *
 *  errors returned:
 *
 *    OK:                      No Error
 *    ERR_TOO_MANY_COMMANDS:   There is a limit of CMD_MAX (see dshlib.h)
 *                             commands.
 *    ERR_CMD_OR_ARGS_TOO_BIG: One of the commands provided by the user
 *                             was larger than allowed, either the
 *                             executable name, or the arg string.
 *
 *  Standard Library Functions You Might Want To Consider Using
 *      memset(), strcmp(), strcpy(), strtok(), strlen(), strchr()
